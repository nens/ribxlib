ribxlib
==========================================

A library for parsing RIBX and RIBXA files, initially for use in the
Upload Server but without unnecessary external dependencies.

Error checking is currently not complete, there is an emphasis on the
fields that are used in the Upload Server (mostly location, ref and
inspection date fields of pipes, manholes and drains).
