36190148 5300093.ribx: This file contains a inspection pipe containing two
headers that have the same reference code (see the <AAA> tag). This should
be parsed as two different measurements. To differentiate between the two
measurements, the starting point (=manhole) of the inspection should be parsed,
which is the <AAB> tag.
